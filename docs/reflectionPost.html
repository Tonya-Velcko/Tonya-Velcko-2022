        <p>My reflection on what I have learned by working with html and css coding!</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>I have learned so much over the course of this semester concerning html coding. I had no prior experience whatsoever, so naturally, going into this unit was daunting. I had to start from scratch; I did not even know the basics of coding! I wish that there was one thing I could name as the hardest or easiest for me to learn, but frankly, it was all difficult. Even changing the background color took me a while to figure out! Even though I do not believe that I will use html or css in my current dream career as a video game designer, it was still imperative that I learned. All coding has a similar foundation, it's the details where everything deviates. So, even though the programming I will be doing will be different, I still have to remember my end tags.</p>
        <p>I did not know what to expect from this class because, as I stated earlier, I had no prior experience. I originally only took this class because it was required for my major. If it had not been, I have to say that I might not have taken it because I would not have thought that I needed these skills for my future. But now, at the end of this unit, I am glad to have been wrong. There is so much that is involved with html that I took for granted. I never realized how complicated it could get! My websites might not be stellar, or even mediocre, frankly, but I am happy with how they turned out, considering the background knowledge I had when I started. I will definitely be practicing in the future!</p>
